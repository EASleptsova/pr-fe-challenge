# Tasks

## Get familiar

Spend some time to familiarise yourself with the code

## Search

Search is broken at the minute - what could be the problem?

## Department filter dropdown

Task: add a department filter dropdown

Consider both placement and how we migh connect the UI with the data.

Use the MUI v4 documentation to find a correct component for this task.

User story:

```
Given: a user from marketing wants to only see employees from that department

Then: they select 'Marketing' from a 'Department' dropdown

Then: the employee list is filtered by that department
```
